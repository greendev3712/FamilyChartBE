        return savedPosition || { x: 0, y: 0 };
    },
});
```

### 3.0.0

### General

#### Goals

We are always trying to move towards logic normalization (be it back end or front end), having the packages encapsulated, easy to work on, maintain, extend and customize.

Keeping the front-end assets together with the back-end code as well as having to publish everything on updates, managing what to overwrite or keep separate, was clearly not natural.

V3 is a big step in the right direction with the extraction of the front-end assets from the Composer packages and their move to individual NPM repositories.

#### Rewrite

All the VueJS components have been rewritten (around 20k LOC have been updated/refactored), and now there is a more logical flow, components communicate better with each other, there's a greater degree of re-usability, removed duplicated logic, less lines of code (the old middleware is gone) and even a bit of extra functionality.

We went for "composition over inheritance" favoring slots over props.

Where it was feasible we created renderless components.

We made use of dependency injection to replace global mixins or to share the state in specific components / libs.

After the refactor most of the middlewares were removed.

We tried to remove all the `scoped` scss styling from the vue components, opening them up for local customization

We added friendly aliases for imports.

#### NPM packages

We strived to create packages for every piece of functionality. This is still an ongoing process.

All the new packages can be found under the @enso-ui organisation on both github and npmjs.

For the active components we went for encapsulating the front end behavior in renderless components, and creating template wrappers.

#### Theming and styling

As before, Enso ships with two themes, one dark and one light. 
The themes and the overall styling have been organized better, offer the possibility of easier customization and can be found in the @enso-ui/themes package.

It's easier to style specific components on both themes by creating a single scss file that uses variables, and place this file under the `/components` folder

#### Development & Customization

If previously, the best/only way to customize some of the pages was to create your own local copies and then making sure you overwrite the default Enso pages with your own versions, now you can customize the assets much easier. You can do this by either rewriting core-routes in your local project and point to local pages, or you can use (patch-package)[https://www.npmjs.com/package/patch-package] and customize anything in a package without having to manually maintain the differences.

You can easily write your own version for any asset while taking advantage of the existing behaviour contained in the renderless components. This even makes switching Enso from Bulma to the CSS framework of your choice much easier.

Therefore, for most packages, you have the possibility to:
- customize the components within the packages and then use patch-package, or
- locally create your own version of the component  and change the imports to use your local component

For the theme customization you can:
- customize the styles within the theme package and then use patch-package, or
- create your own theme, locally, and change the theme import in webpack.mix.js

You can develop your own components and pages by importing just the bits and pieces you need.

Remember, should you need a custom behavior for a component, or your own version of a component with different styling you can build it your own way as most complex components have the core logic encapsulated in renderless components.

If making package fixes we kindly ask you to also open a github issue and a pull request, since this helps the whole community.

#### Enso vs Standalone

In the past, even if we're done our best to make some of the components work outside of the Enso ecosystem, there hasn't been a clear distinction between the integrated and the standalone components.

With the rewrite, all the packages were designed to be also Enso independent, and may be used in any vue project.

If you are developing your project within the Enso ecosystem, the Enso versions of the components offer a tighter integration into the framework, 
automatically determining and using:
- the user's locale
- dynamically determined routes
- the internationalization helper
- the app's error handling
- the user's date format

#### Bug Fixes & Improvements
- page transitions are in better sync
- the theme changing system was refactored and it's more efficient
- the bookmarks bar is sticky
- the document title is properly handled / translated
- totals & numbers alignment in vue table
- several levels of span removed in vue table
- several edge cases fixed in vue-select

    - `auth`,
    - `dashboard`,
    - `dataimport`,
    - `files`,
    - `howtovideos`,
    - `notifications`,

    - `system.js`,
    - `unauthorized.js`

- delete the following `resources/js/store` subfolders:
    - `layout`,
    - `auth.js`,
    - `bookmarks.js`,
    - `layout.js`,
    - `localisation`,
    - `menus.js`,
    - `preferences.js`

    - `enso.js`
    - `router.js`
    - `selectExample.js`
    - `store.js`
    - `tableExample.js`

- `composer install && composer update`

- `php artisan enso:upgrade`

- run `php artisan horizon:install`

- republish the resources: `php artisan vendor:publish --tag=horizon-assets --force`

- update the Horizon `gate()` method in the published `HorizonApplicationServiceProvider` to:
```php
{
    Gate::define('viewHorizon', function ($user) {
        return auth()->check() && $user->isAdmin();
    });
}
```

- if necessary, update `App\Exceptions\Handler` to include the new sentry reporting syntax

- update the sentry config and remove the `user_context` option which is now deprecated

- `yarn install && yarn upgrade`

- `canAccess` must be injected where it is used

- if you have customized Enso, use `patch-package` to reapply those customizations for each individual package. Note that when using yarn, the [postinstall-postinstall](https://github.com/ds300/patch-package#why-use-postinstall-postinstall-with-yarn) package is also needed.

- build

- replace all relative RouterView imports such as `const RouterView = () => import('../../../core/Router.vue');` with the package import `const RouterView = () => import('@core-pages/Router.vue');`

- replace relative routeImporer imports such as: `import routeImporter from '../modules/importers/routeImporter;` with the package import : `import routeImporter from '@core-modules/importers/routeImporter';`

- replace relative date-fns imports such as: `import format from '../../../modules/enso/plugins/date-fns/format;` with the package import `import format from '@core-modules/plugins/date-fns/format';` (notably `format`, `formatDistance`) 

- comment out the import of the `tiptap-extensions` from `/resources/js/components/enso/vueforms/Wysiwyg.vue`

- in `resources/images` ensure you have `earthlink.svg` & `enso-favicon.png`

- when adding your own local routes that overwrite or reuse part or the core routes, ensure that 
within the route file you expose only the `path` and the `children` properties. If you also set the `meta` property, that would result in having the core routes overwritten by your local routes vs having the local routes merged into the core routes.

- move the icon imports from `resources/js/core/structure/menu/icons/app.js` to `resources/js/app.js`

- Migrate all pages/components by looking at the [New Packages section](#new-packages).

- inject `i18n` and `errorHandler` everywhere they're used

### 2.14.0

#### Changes
This is one of the biggest releases until now, with changes such as the complete rewrite of the Data Import package, the rewrite and improvement of the DataTable Export functionality, enhancements and new functionality for the VueForm and much more.
The improvements brought to the DataTable Export and the DataImport now allow the export of practically unlimited records from a datatable, as well as the import of xlsx files limited only by your ability to create them and the limitations of the file format.
That's not all though, as the new mechanisms also become much much more efficient due to the parallelization of the operations. This is made possible by leveraging Laravel's queueing facilities and impressive load balancing.
Together with the refreshed web socketed operations' progress reporting we now have hugely powerful, high throughput solutions for I/O operations.
This is yet another step towards our vision for Enso and rest assured, there is more to come.

##### Core
- adds IO structure for monitoring background export/import operations progress in real-time (needs websockets). It will soon be refactored and extracted to its own separate package
- fixes the global search on medium screen sized devices
- refactors the request management helpers
- adds params support for translations, thanks to @jlsjonas
- fixes translation for the `auth` layout
- adds a `shortNumber` filter ( `{{ 1000 | shortNumber }} // 1k`)
- globally adds the `font-awesome-layers` component under the name of `fal`
- both the `dataimport` and `companies` packages are now required by `core` and are no longer optional

##### DataExport
- adds `type`, `entries`, `status` and `created_by` columns to the table
- uses the `CreatedBy` trait
- integrates with the new background operations management system (IO) for real time progress in the FE

##### DataImport
- completely redesigned the package and import philosophy. Adds support for a virtually infinite number of rows that can imported in the same import with very low memory consumption, by splitting the import file in chunks and processing them in queued jobs
- adds queue management
- generates a downloadable xlsx rejected rows summary if there are import validation errors. The summary has the same structure as the import file with an extra column (on each sheet) that will describe all the validation errors for each row. This will streamline the import operations when dealing with large files
- improves local (dev's) import and validation classes
- adds `before` and `after` hooks which are available in the importing process
- integrates with the new background operations management system (IO) for real time progress in the FE
- comes with a new `import-uploader` component that can be placed anywhere in the applications for local imports

##### Helpers
- enhances the `Obj` class. Now it can receive any object or associative array, including Laravel collections, and even Models with loaded relations. 
- changed the `Obj@get($key)` method to return `null` for an unset `$key`, instead of throwing an exception
- enhances the Enum by reordering the data source priority. Take a look at `LaravelEnso\Examples\app\Enums\SeniorityEnum` for an example

##### FormBuilder
- adds the `tabs` property to the form template root. If provided, it will require a `tab` property for each section, which will represent the tab's label. The sections will be grouped in tabs using their given labels
- the delete modal has the commit button focused by default
- exposes a series of getters/helpers from `vue-from` and `enso-form` that can be accessed via `$refs`:
    - computed:
        - `data` - represents the whole object
        - `customFields` - represents  custom fields array
        - `errors` - represents the errors object
    - methods
        - `formData()` - returns the params that are sent to the server on POST / PATCH
        - `field(field)` - returns the field object for a given label
        - `param(param)` - returns the specified param from the optional `params` object
        - `routeParam(param)` - returns the route param from the `routeParams` object
        - `fetch()` - form's fetch method for getting the template

##### VueComponents
- removes the deprecated `MorpableContainer`
- adds a new `enso-tabs` component. The old `tabs` component is visually limited to the Bulma available options. `enso-tabs` has less props and displays the custom tabs used in the Files menu, the `accesories` component and in `vue-form` (new!)
- adds compact mode to `accesories`

##### VueDatatable
- adds practically unlimited excel export functionality by greatly improving the table fetcher. The whole process is done in the background and uses a small amount of memory. You should consider using appropriate values for the configuration options `enso.datatable.exports.timeout` and for the `queues.connections.yourConnection.retry_after`
- improves the builder logic and reusability
- optimizes the Builder for date / enum / translatable computing
- renamed the `translation` template param to `translatable`
- the (delete) modal accepts `shift-enter` as a keyboard shortcut for the commit action
- changes the way actions are processed. Now, in the `CustomAction@process` class / method only one `$row` at a time will be available
- adds options for customizing the export & notification queues
- integrates with the new background operations management system (IO) for real time progress in the FE

#### Upgrade instructions - estimated time per project ~ 10-15min
- update in `composer.json`: "laravel-enso/core": "3.4.*"
- from `composer.json`, remove the packages:
    * "laravel-enso/companies"
    * "laravel-enso/dataimport"
- run `composer update`
- run `php artisan migrate`
- run `yarn upgrade`
- run `yarn run dev`
- run `php artisan enso:upgrade`
- add the new route in your `routes/channels.php` file
    ```php
    Broadcast::channel('operations.{userId}', function ($user, $operationId) {
        return (int) $user->id === (int) $operationId;
    });
    ```
- in your `config/queue.php` file make sure that you set `retry_after` to a higher value for the imports / exports connection (we are using 1800)
- update the configuration files with the newly introduced options:
    * `config/enso/imports.php` with `vendor/laravel-enso/dataimport/src/config/imports.php`
    * `config/enso/datatable.php` with `vendor/laravel-enso/vuedatatable/src/config/datatable.php`
- configure your `config/horizon.php` to make sure that you have the appropriate queues for both local and production envs. You can use the config from this repo as an example.
- refactor your import classes and validators to match the new structure
- if necessary, in your table templates, rename the attribute `translation` to `translatable` 
- sync `phpunit.xml` with the one from the main repo

### 2.13.17

- fixes small bugs
- upgrades date-fns to the latest alpha

To upgrade existing projects:

- run `composer update`

### 2.13.16

#### Changes and upgrade instructions:

##### General
- renames `initialised` to `ready` in `Auth.vue`, `activityLog/Index.vue`, 'teams/Index.vue`. If you were using this flag be sure to update your local code.

##### VueDatatable
- adds label and tooltip support for row buttons
- renames `getData()` to `fetch()`. If you were calling `this.$refs.table.getData()` in the code be sure to rename it

##### FormBuilder
- adds template fetching logic VueForm similar to VueTable
- adds EnsoForm for using VueForm in the Enso environment. VueFormSS is be deprecated and must be replaced with EnsoForm. For existing projects you can safely search & replace all instances of `vue-form-ss` with `enso-form` and `VueFormSS` with `EnsoForm`
- adds & refactors field helpers in VueForm / EnsoForm:
    - `field(value)`
    - `param(param)`
    - `routeParam(param)`
    - `customFields` - computed property

To upgrade besides the above notes you must manually bump the core version in your composer.json:

Upgrade steps:

- update `telescope.php` with the one provided in the project
- in `web.php` file change the SPA redirect from

```php
Route::get('/{any}', function () {
    return view('laravel-enso/core::index');

- adds `fixed-width` for menu icons
- fixes some UI bugs

### 2.13.1
- minor bug fixes
- improves search to work with model relations
- adds `DateFilter.vue` - implemented in Files menu

### 2.13.0

#### General
This version greatly improves the permission management system by simplifiyng parts of the core structure and generally allowing for more flexibility.

It also adds a set of changes that widen convention based matchings (for routes, parameters, models, etc.) while reducing a significant amount of lines of code and improving readability.

The permissions table provides all the needed information when checking user access for both routes and menus. That said, the `menu_role` pivot table was dropped as it's no longer needed. The menus section from the role configurator was also dropped and the UI streamlined.

The menu table was improved by replacing the `link` column, that was previously string and stored the permission name, with `permission_id` (nullable for parent menus).

The `Permission Groups` were also dropped (menu, table, relation to permissions). The grouping for permission is determined dynamically based on the route name prefixes. This permits  any type of nested routes structure and removes the previous restriction of having to provide the same number of depth levels for all the route subgroups. Now we can have `administration.companies.routeNames` and also `administration.companies.contacts.routeName` and the improved interface will handle this structure.

The frontend routing was adjusted slightly to better match the backend routing, in the sense that all the route parameters are now named after the model instead of the generic `id`  (for instance, `adminisration/users/:id/edit` became `administration/users/:user/edit`) similar to Laravel conventions.

Read all the notes below before jumping to the `Upgrade steps`. 

#### AddressManager

#### Upgrading existing projects

##### Important Notes
- make sure you read all of the above.
- the upgrade steps presented below will work only for Enso **v2.12.8**. If you are not already at this version, make sure that you upgrade to v2.12.8 before jumping to v2.13.x

##### Upgrade steps
- update in your `composer.json`: "laravel-enso/core": "3.2.*",
- run `composer update`
- run `php artisan vendor:publish --tag=menus-factory --force
- run `php artisan vendor:publish --tag=roles-seeder --force
- run `php artisan enso:upgrade`

**search & replace**

- search the whole project for `protected $permissionGroup` and remove the property from all structure migrations (optional)
- search for `getTableData` and replace it with `tableData` in all the route files and structure migrations
- search for `readSuffix` in your table templates and remove it if you want to use the global `dataRouteSuffix` from the config or replace it with `dataRouteSuffix` if you need a custom one
- add the `'dataRouteSuffix' => 'tableData',` line in your `config/enso/datatable.php` config file
- search for `'link' => '` and replace it with `'route' => '` in all your structure migrations
- search for `'id' => $` in all your crud controllers (store() methods) and update the returned array from
`'id' => $model->id,` to `'param' => ['model' => $model->id],` where `model` will correspond to the according path segment (model name)
- search for `:id` in all your frontend routes and replace `id` with `model` where model is the actual camelCase model, matched with the one from the backend route.
- search for `:route-params="[$route.name, null, false]"` in your 'Create' pages and remove it. Now the vue-form-ss defaults to this. (optional)
- search for `:route-params="[$route.name, $route.params.id, false]"` in your edit pages and remove it. (optional)

### 2.12.0

Facing our latest challenges we decided to change the way users are handled in Enso by introducing a new structure of *people*. This was the main objective of this upgrade.

Some of the people will be users (all users are people), some can be contacts (soon), some can be clients or employees, and some can be of all types at once. This structure will handle all the personal information for persons that are relevant to the app.

The second objective was cleaning up and improving the code, trying to make everything simpler and more consistent. We tried to rename what was was confusing, to move logic to where it belongs and so on. 

The majority of tests were also improved.

#### Upgrade steps
For existing projects we created an upgrade command that will take care of most of the changes, like migrating the current user table into two tables, users & people, and so on.

Make sure you have a backup of your database before starting. If you find any problems use the issue tracker to let us know.

- update `composer.json` dependencies:
    - "laravel-enso/addressesmanager": "2.4.*",
    - "laravel-enso/commentsmanager": "2.4.*",
    - "laravel-enso/companies": "1.0.*",
    - "laravel-enso/contacts": "2.3.*",
    - "laravel-enso/dataimport": "2.5.*",
    - "laravel-enso/discussions": "1.1.*",
    - "laravel-enso/documentsmanager": "2.4.*",
    - "laravel-enso/howtovideos": "2.2.*",
    - "laravel-enso/teams": "1.0.*",
- run `composer update`
- run `php artisan enso:upgrade`
- run `php artisan migrate`
- run `php artisan enso:upgrade` (again, don't ask :) )
- run `php artisan enso:update-global-preferences`
- run `php artisan enso:track-who:update`
- read the individual package changes below, and where you find upgrade instructions follow those steps.
- run `yarn dev` / `npm run dev`

Note: The upgrade command will do the following:
- rename migrations to match the new names (for example the owner related migrations)
- rename the `owners` & `owner_role` tables and relevant relation columns
- prepares the `users` table to work with `people`
- splits users data into `users` and `people`
- removes all the deprecated permissions and renames one that were changed (`selectOptions` => `options` and so on)
- updates the menus to reflect the new structures;

#### ActionLogger
##### Changes
- renamed the `HasActionLogs` trait to `ActionLogs`
- improved test

##### Upgrade
This change should not affect existing projects.

#### ActivityLog
##### Changes
- renamed the `LogActivity` trait to `LogsActivity`
- the logger will not attempt to persist data when there is no authenticated user - this was causing problems when using seeder / playing in tinker etc

##### Upgrade
Search in the whole project for `LogActivity` and replace it with `LogsActivity`.

#### AddressesManager
##### Changes
- **changed how the morphable relation is handled** <a id="morphable"></a>
- the front-end component works now takes the destination model's *classname* instead of an alias
-  the `addressable_type` and `addressable_id` are dynamically assigned in the form object inside the `AddressForm` component
- the index request is now validated and helps the dev properly configure the front-end component
- as a result of these changes:
    - the back-end logic is more natural without having to create a custom store method
    - there is no need for the `addressable` key from the `addresses.php` config, it can now be removed
    - the `ConfigMapper` was deprecated and removed

- an observer was added that will automatically set the first added address as the default
- the `countriesSelectOptions` route/permission was renamed to `countryOptions`

##### Upgrade
To upgrade, manually replace the provided `type` property where the front-end component is used, replacing the old alias with the mapped class from the `addresses.php` config. Afterwards, remove the `addressable` key from the config. (see [this change](https://github.com/laravel-enso/Enso/commit/be5743c80bf028468ae5dbf30956b5c87d30c634#diff-c55ea2ae73bcf4f5d68ad75da15d5546) for an example)

### 2.12.0-beta

You definately shouldn't update to this version. In the next days we will refine the upgrade process and commit a new version with the full changelog. Stay tuned...

### 2.11.13
Improves history tabs. When updating existing apps use the delete button to clear previous tabs from the local storage to fully make use of the new behavior.

### 2.11.12

After a thorough analysis we decided to slighly change the behaviour of `TrackWho`. In all the traits `auth()->user()->id` was changed to `optional(auth()->user())->id`. This way we allow easier tests, seeders, tinker playing etc., on models that use one ore more of the three traits. In conjunction with this move, all the tables that have `created_by` should update the column to be `nullable()`. For Enso's tables we added a command for this `enso:track-who:update`
- removes unnecessary logic from `UserSeeder` and `OwnerSeeder`
- fixes tabs/custom tabs css

Changes and upgrade instructions:

- update in your `composer.json` the `core` requirement to `"laravel-enso/core": "3.1.*",`
- the examples were moved in a dedicated `examples` package. To upgrade, remove everyting related to examples:
    - remove the files (copy everything below in one take and paste it into the terminal)
        ```
        rm app/Example.php
        rm -R app/Http/Controllers/Examples
        rm database/factories/ExampleFactory.php
        rm database/migrations/2018_01_29_204255_create_examples_table.php
        rm -R resources/views/examples
        rm -R resources/assets/js/tableExample.js
        rm -R resources/assets/js/selectExample.js
        ```
    - remove the routes under the `Examples` namespace from the `routes/web.php` file:
        ```php
        Route::namespace('Examples')
            ->prefix('examples')->as('examples.')
            ->group(function () {
                Route::view('table', 'examples.table.index')->name('table');

                Route::prefix('table')->as('table.')
                    ->group(function () {
                        Route::get('init', 'TableController@init')->name('init');
                        Route::get('data', 'TableController@data')->name('data');
                        Route::get('exportExcel', 'TableController@exportExcel')->name('exportExcel');
                    });

                Route::view('select', 'examples.select.index')->name('select');

                Route::prefix('select')->as('select.')
                    ->group(function () {
                        Route::get('employee', 'EmployeeSelectController@options')->name('employee');
                    });
            });
        ```
    - remove from webpack the following lines:
        ```js
        .js('resources/js/tableExample.js', 'public/js')
        .js('resources/js/selectExample.js', 'public/js')
        ```
    - NOTE: if you still need examples in your project (the dashboard for instance) run `composer require laravel-enso/examples`, put back in `webpack.js` the two lines from the previous step and run `php artisan vendor:publish --force --tag="examples-assets"
- the `Owner` & `User` models were moved to `core`. To upgrade
    - remove `app/Owner.php`. If in the future you will need customization over this model you can create it locally but be sure to extend the one from core.
    - update `app/User.php` content to:
        ```php
        <?php

            namespace App;

            use LaravelEnso\Core\app\Models\User as EnsoUser;

            class User extends EnsoUser
            {
                //
            }
        ```
        If you have customizations, add them as well
- the form and tables (buiders, template, controllers) and the corresponding routes were moved to the `core` package. To upgrade, remove the following files/routes (if you customized some of the files then skip those and the corresponding routes if appliable):
    - `app/Forms/Builders/UserForm.php`
    - `app/Forms/Builders/OwnerForm.php`
    - `app/Forms/Templates/user.php`
    - `app/Forms/Templates/owner.php`
    - `app/Tables/Builders/OwnerTable.php`
    - `app/Tables/Builders/UserTable.php`
    - `app/Tables/Templates/owners.php`
    - `app/Tables/Templates/users.php`
    - `app/Http/Controllers/Administration/*`
    - `app/Http/Requests/ValidateOwnerRequest.php`
    - `app/Http/Requests/ValidateUserRequest.php`
    - `database/migrations/2017_01_01_108000_create_owners_table.php`
    - `database/migrations/2018_01_29_204255_create_examples_table.php`
    - from the `api.php` remove the lines related to user & owner:
        ```php
        Route::middleware(['auth', 'core'])
            ->group(function () {
                Route::namespace('Administration')
                    ->prefix('administration')->as('administration.')
                    ->group(function () {
                        Route::namespace('Owner')
                            ->prefix('owners')->as('owners.')
                            ->group(function () {
                                Route::get('initTable', 'OwnerTableController@init')
                                    ->name('initTable');
                                Route::get('getTableData', 'OwnerTableController@data')
                                    ->name('getTableData');
                                Route::get('exportExcel', 'OwnerTableController@excel')
                                    ->name('exportExcel');

                                Route::get('selectOptions', 'OwnerSelectController@options')
                                    ->name('selectOptions');
                            });

                        Route::resource('owners', 'Owner\OwnerController', ['except' => ['show', 'index']]);

                        Route::namespace('User')
                            ->prefix('users')->as('users.')
                            ->group(function () {
                                Route::get('initTable', 'UserTableController@init')
                                    ->name('initTable');
                                Route::get('getTableData', 'UserTableController@data')
                                    ->name('getTableData');
                                Route::get('exportExcel', 'UserTableController@excel')
                                    ->name('exportExcel');

                                Route::get('selectOptions', 'UserSelectController@options')
                                    ->name('selectOptions');
                            });

                        Route::resource('users', 'User\UserController', ['except' => ['index']]);
                    });
            });
        ```
- the user & owner tests were moved to the `core` package. to upgrade:
    - add in your `phpunit.xml` the `core` test suite
        ```xml
        <testsuite name="core">
            <directory suffix="Test.php">./vendor/laravel-enso/core/tests/features</directory>
        </testsuite>
        ```
    - remove `tests/Feature/OwnerTest.php`
    - remove `tests/Feature/UserTest.php`
- the `UserPolicy` was moved to the `core` package and consolidated with the `ImpersonatePolicy`. Also the `Horizon` authentication was moved to the `core` `AuthServiceProvider` upgrade:
    - remove `app/Policies/UserPolicy.php`
    - update `app/Providers/AuthServiceProvider.php` to to following content:
        ```php
        <?php

        namespace App\Providers;

        use Illuminate\Foundation\Support\Providers\AuthServiceProvider as ServiceProvider;

        class AuthServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
        {
            protected $policies = [
                //
            ];

            public function boot()
            {
                $this->registerPolicies();
            }
        }

        ```

    - `database/factories/UserFactory.php`
    - `database/seeds/OwnerSeeder.php`
    - `database/seeds/UserSeeder.php`
- Note: If you used the `Owner` class for morphable packages, update the `morphable_type` in the `addresses`, `contacts`, `comments`, `documents` tables from `App\Owner` to `LaravelEnso\Core\app\Models\Owner`

### 2.10.8

- fixes some edge cases potential bugs in `vue-select` and `vue-form`

### 2.10.2

Laravel 5.7 adds, as usual, small changes to the core / config files. A new thing is the flat resources folder.

This update aligns everything in Enso with Laravel 5.7's changes.

Updating an existing project:

- move everything from `resources/assets/*` to `resources/*`
- manually update/add the following files to match the ones from Enso's repo:
    - `app/Http/Controllers/Auth/VerificationController.php`
    - `app/Http/Kernel.php`
    - `app/Http/Middleware/Authenticate.php`
    - `app/Http/Middleware/VerifyCsrfToken.php`
    - `app/Providers/RouteServiceProvider.php`
    - `config/app.php`
    - `config/enso/config.php`
    - `config/hashing.php`
    - `config/logging.php`

    - `webpack.mix.js`

- update in `composer.json`
    - `"laravel-enso/charts": "2.5.*",`
    - `"laravel-enso/core": "2.15.*",`

### 2.10.1

Laravel 5.7 upgrade

We decided to cleanup the project's root and to try to make Enso installable on any existing or new Laravel application. This is a direction / objective that we'll follow in the near future.

#### Changes

- Laravel 5.7 upgrade :)
- improved Enso's `Toastr`, now allowing 6 positions (desktop corners)
- new preferences setting that for customizing the toastr position
- bulma dropdown now hides after a selection is made by default. Has a new `hides-manually` prop
- updated the vuedatatable style selector and columns visibility dropdowns
- updated the dropdowns from setttings (right aside bar)
- moves the auth controllers to the core package, leaving the ones from the base project back to Laravel's original.
- removed the deprecated `Nprogress.vue` component from `vue-components` repo
- replaces `nprogress` dependency with an in house progress bar implementation that is integrated in the core. Now the animation is indeed controlled and the effect more natural
- adds a `requests` array to the app's state that tracks all the pending requests. From now on the application won't allow a second requests to the same endpoint / method before receiving the response for the initial one. Le me know your thoughs on this...
- adds the missing `StructureManager` tests to `phpunit.xml`
- adds desktop notifications - ref laravel-enso/enso#136

#### Upgrading an existing project

- first be sure that you follow [L5.7 upgrade guide](https://laravel.com/docs/5.7/upgrade)
- update in your `composer.json`: `"laravel/framework": "5.7.*",`
- update in your `composer.json`: `"sentry/sentry-laravel": "dev-laravel-57@dev",`
- unless you already customized the auth routes already remove from your `api.php` routes file the whole route group under the `Auth` namespace. - now they are loaded from the core package
- replace the four auth controllers with the ones from this repo (`app/Http/Controllers/Auth/*`)
- add to your `phpunit.xml` the test suite for `StructureManager`
- run `php artisan enso:clear-preferences`
- run `php artisan vendor:publish --tag=enso-preferences --force`
- remove `nprogress` from your `package.json` and run `yarn upgrade`

### 2.10.0

This is a mostly a back end refactor.

Among the goals:
- dropping all the accessors (appends) that were using relationships in favor of getters
- adding query scopes where they were missing
- implementing resources ... something that we wanted for months
- making all FormBuilders DRY
- cleaning up and aligning all the service providers
- refined tests
- improving the form request validators
- getting the project mature...

#### Additions & Changes

##### Activity Log
- refactored main query into scopes

##### AddressesManager
- adds `Address` resource
- adds `buildingTypes` and resource attributes to the config

##### AvatarMangager
- drops the `getAvatarIdAttribute`.
- adds an `created` event listener on the `User` model which automagically generates a new avatar for every created user
- adds the `generateAvatar()` method that can be called on any User. Note, in order to use this method you will have to be authenticated because the avatar relies on the `File` model that uses the `CreatedBy` trait.
- adds `php artisan enso:avatars:generate` - command that generates all the missing avatars

##### CommentsManager
- adds `Comment` resource. Major backend refactor

##### Core
- `Resource::withoutWrapping()` was added in the `AppServiceProvider`. Let's hope that this is a good decision :)
- `avatarId` was removed from the user's model `protected $fillable` array. Don't forget to do the same in your existing project(s). Read **Upgrade Instructions** for more details
- adds a `Team` resource
- adds the `Update` command

##### DocumentsManager:
- added document request validation
- added a new `ordered()` scope (most recent first)
- added the `Document` resource

#### HowToVideo
- clean up, added resources

##### TrackWho
- we have now a `TrackWho` resource and a `trackWho` config (publishable). You can customize the attributes in the `TrackWho` resource from the config.

##### FileManager
- added the `File` resource.

##### FormBuilder
- fixed a validation for multiple selects with mutated value.

#### RolesManager
- turned the `getRoleListAttribute` accessor into a getter - `rolesList()` in `HasRoles` trait. Updated the formbuilders for the models that were using this trait to use the getter instead of the accessor

#### Upgrade Instructions *~ 3-5 mins*
- update in composer.json: "laravel-enso/core": "2.14.*"
- run `composer update`
- run `php artisan enso:update` - this command will align some inconsistent column types and clear unused columns
- remove the `avatarId` field from the `protected $fillable` array in your `App\User` model
- update the avatar column definition in your `app/Forms/Templates/users.json` table template to
```json
{
    "label": "",
    "name": "avatarId",
    "data": "avatars.avatarId",
    "meta": ["slot"],
    "class": "is-paddingless"
},
```
- remove from the same template (`users.json`) the deprecated `avatarId` from the appends array. The result should be `"appends": ["fullName"],`
- update in `app/Tables/Builders/UserTable.php` the query method to:
```php
public function query()
{
    return User::select(\DB::raw(
            'users.id, users.id as "dtRowId", avatars.id as avatarId, owners.name as owner,
            users.first_name, users.last_name, users.phone, users.email, roles.name as role,
            users.is_active'
        ))->join('owners', 'users.owner_id', '=', 'owners.id')
        ->join('roles', 'users.role_id', '=', 'roles.id')
        ->leftJoin('avatars', 'users.id', '=', 'avatars.user_id');
}
```
- replace both `app/Forms/Builders/OwnerForm.php` & `app/Forms/Builders/UserForm.php` with the ones from the repo (this is not mandatory, and must be done with care if you have already customized your local builders)
```
- sync the `config/enso/config.php` keys with the keys from `vendor/laravel-enso/core/src/config/config.php`
- replace `tests/Feature/OwnerTest.php` &&  `tests/Feature/UserTest.php` with the one from the repo - or manually update if you have local changes
- modify the slot rendering in `resources/assets/js/pages/administration/users/Index.vue` to
```vue
<img class="is-rounded"
    :src="avatarLink(row.avatarId)"
    v-if="row.avatarId">
```
- add in 'database/seeds/UserSeeder.php` after the actual seed the following line`\Artisan::call('enso:avatars:generate');`

### 2.9.0

This version is a major backend refactor. It has breaking changes so read carefully the needed steps for upgrading existing projects. We created an artisan command that does all the hard work during the upgrade, so don't worry.

#### Changes

##### File System
- the file system has been rewritten around a single `FileManager` class that makes full use of Laravel's `UploadedFile` class
- there is a `files` table now that keeps track of all the files in the application. The `File` model has a polymorphic 'attachable` relationship to any needed model.
- to develop new packages that work with file uploads all you need is the new `HasFile` trait and implementing the `Attachable` contract. 
The trait creates a `file` `morphOne` relationship to the base model and makes available all the needed methods: `inline()`, `download()`, `upload(UploadedFile $file)`. There are also helpers (check the contract / trait) and protected properties that can be used for configuring the specific of the model related to files, like:
    - `folder`: string the storage folder for the model's files
    - `mimeTypes`: array
    - `extensions`: array
    - `resizeImages`: array(width, height)
    - `optimizeImages`: boolean
- the trait adds a `deleting` event on the base model that makes sure the to associated files are delelted on `$model->delete()`
- when the env is testing `FileManager` uses a `testing` folder
- upgraded packages: AvatarManager, DataImport, DocumentsManager, FileManager, HowToVideos

##### Seeders
- until now the app was using migrations instead of seeders for inserting the default roles, owner and user. This version adds seeders for roles, default user, default owners, and countries (for the addresses package)
- the seeders can be published with `php artisan vendor:publish --tag=enso-seeders`. Use the `--force` flag if needed.

#### Roles
- we have now a `php artisan enso:roles:sync` command that will help keeping the all the environments up to date.

#### Upgrade steps for existing projects

- update in composer.json the following:
    - "laravel-enso/core": "2.13.*",
    - "laravel-enso/dataimport": "2.3.*",
    - "laravel-enso/documentsmanager": "2.3.*",
    - "laravel-enso/howtovideos": "2.1.*",
- run `composer update`
- run `php artisan migrate`
- run `php artisan enso:filemanager:upgrade`. This command will translate all the tables from the old format to the new one. It's recommended to make a backup of the database before the update, just to be sure that nothing goes wrong.
- run `php artisan vendor:publish --tag=enso-seeders --force` to update the seeders (Database, Role, Owner & User) if you didn't make any customizations to the existing ones.

##### Files & Folders to delete
- remove the `insert_default_owner` & `insert_default_user` migrations
- remove the `app/storage/temp` folder, it's no longer needed

##### Files that need to be replaced & edited according to the repo
- sync the `config/enso/config.php` keys with the keys from `vendor/laravel-enso/core/src/config/config.php`
- replace `tests/Feature/OwnerTest.php` with the one from the repo.
- replace `tests/Feature/UserTest.php` with the one from the repo.
- replace `resources/assets/js/pages/administration/users/Index.vue` with the one from the repo.
- edit `storage/app/.gitignore` file and replace `temp` with `testing`
- add in `app/User.php` the `avatarId` attribute to fillable
- add in `app/Tables/Builders/UserTable.php` `users.id` to the table select (`users.id, users.id as "dtRowId"`). We need this for showing the avatar in the users index table
- replace `app/Tables/Templates/users.json` with the one from the repo.

#### Notes
- this is a pretty heavy upgrade, if you find any problems open issues in github, issues for this upgrade will be prioritized

### 2.8.23

- major redesign of vue-table component. The title / icon props were removed.

Upgrade steps to make your current project look like the demo.
    - update in `datatable.php`
        - **row** button classes to `is-row-button` (optional, old classes still work)
        - **global** button classes to null (optional)

- adds `.is-raised` helper
- adds link to author's profile in activity log

### 2.8.21

- adds ability to change the password from the user form. Users can change only their own password.

To upgrade an existing project you will have to copy by hand from a fresh Enso project the following files:

- `app/Forms/Builders/UserForm.php`
- `app/Forms/Templates/user.json`
- `app/Http/Controllers/Administration/User/UserController.php`

Now you can audit your user's activity within the application from the new menu.

To upgrade an existing project update in your `composer.json`: "laravel-enso/core": "2.12.*" and after the update run the migrations. If you want smarter logging for contacts, addresses, comments & documents update their configs matching the ones from a blank project.

The documentation will be updated soon.

Meanwhile, take a look at the new `LogsActivity` trait. For examples peek at the `User` model from a blank project and for polymorphic relations at the `Comment` model from the `CommentsManager` packages.

### 2.8.18

- adds custom totals in VueTable.

### 2.8.17

- upgrades Laravel to 5.6.31
- adds `app/Http/Middleware/CheckForMaintenanceMode.php` to the project. In an existing project you should copy it by hand if needed.

- addressed a role configurator bug when having more than one menu with the same name
- moved the logic for handling missing translation keys to the store `localisation` module
- many other front-end cleanup & optimizations 
- tree permission builder refactor for the back-end role configurator
- added logic to handle front-end only permissions, with no corresponding back-end routes

For an existing project the upgrade estimated time is ~ 5min. **TESTED**

To upgrade a project do the following:
* update `composer.json` for the new core version to `2.10.*` (please double check all the enso requirements against a composer.json from a fresh project)
* run `composer update`
* run `php artisan enso:add-missing-permissions`
* make sure to manually add to the permissions table all the FE-only permissions and attach them to the according roles
* following is the reorganized structure (read with care!!!) of the core application layout files:
    - `js/core` 
        - `structure`: the structural sub-components of the app
            - `navbar` (top)
            - `sidebar` (left) -> bring your own `/icons/app.js` file under this folder
            - `settings` (right sidebar)
            - `AppFooter.vue`: -> use your own file
            - `Breadcrumbs.vue`
            - `PageHeader.vue`
            - `VueAside.vue`
        - `App.vue`
        - `NotFound.vue`
        - `Router.vue` -> Update the path to this file in all the routes / pages that use the Router
        - `Unauthorized.vue`

* remove the old `js/pages/layout` with all its content

* nprogress usage
    - if using the nprogess events, replace old logic as these events have been removed:
        - `nprogress-add-request`
        - `nprogress-add-response`
        - `nprogress-done`
    - the nprogress instance is now directly available in the Vue root instance with `this.$router.app.$nprogress` with `incRequests()` / `incResponses()` methods

* middleware
    - the referenced files are:
        - `js/middleware/before/allow.js` -> used for restricting access on forbidden routes
        - `js/middleware/before/auth.js`
        - `js/middleware/before/nprogress.js`
        - `js/middleware/before/guest.js`
        - `js/middleware/after/nprogress.js`
        - `js/middleware/after/documentTitle.js`        
    
* authentication pages/components, will be published automatically on update
    - the referenced files are:
        - `js/pages/auth/AuthForm.vue`
        - `js/pages/auth/Login.vue`
        - `js/pages/auth/password/Email.vue`
        - `js/pages/auth/password/Reset.vue`
    
* dashboard
    - the referenced file is:
        - `js/pages/dashboard/Index.vue` -> it needs to be copied from the Enso repository, overwriting the existing file

* administration routes
    - the referenced files are:
        - `js/routes/administration.js`
        - `js/routes/administration/owners.js`
        - `js/routes/administration/users.js`
    - the above files have been updated and need to be copied from the Enso repository,  overwriting the existing files

* run `npm run dev`
* sync the routes in `routes/api.php` with the ones from a fresh project

### 2.7.11
General BE refactor.

Steps for upgrade:
- update in your composer.json file the requirement for core: `"laravel-enso/core": "2.9.*"`
- `php artisan enso:update-action-logs-table`

To use this feature point `stateBuilder` to a class that implements `LaravelEnso\Core\app\Contracts\StateBuilder` contract, and then make sure that you have the `resources/assets/js/localState.js` plugin, that should look like this:
    ```
    export default (context, state) => {
        // initalise the local state
    };
    ```
    where `state` is the what your local `StateBuilder` is returning.

Upgrade instructions:

- Copy from a fresh project the 'app\Http\Controllers\ChartController.php'. Copy the `resources/assets/js/pages/dashboard/Index.vue` component as well, if you didn't already for v2.7.1. Sorry about that, but what I did to the poor charts was an abomination and I had to roll it back.
