Finally decided to start keeping a changelog for the main project.

#### Improvements

- dynamic loading for store and routes via `storeImporter` and `routeImporter` helper functions
- lazy loading for routes
- removed the old prototypes and refactored the code accordingly
- visual refactor for `VueForm`, `VueSelect`, `Comments` and `Documents`. `Contacts` and `Addresses` will follow shortly

- new component: `Popup`
- major cleanup of all components, libs, imports
- jQuery is now used only in `Comments/Inputor.vue` until we find a js only lib to replace at.js
